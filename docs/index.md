###What is it?
GameCheetah is an AS3 SWC library designed to take out all of the boring parts of game development in FlashDevelop or FlashBuilder.

###What does it do?
If you want to skip directly to implementing the game mechanics for your next game instead of optimizing and managing graphics, sound and collision detection, then this engine is made with you in mind!

###Attributions
GameCheetah was originally inspired by FlashPunk another AS3 game creation library, but focuses on areas where performance and workflow could have improved.
